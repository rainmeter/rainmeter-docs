<p><a href="!meters">Meters</a> can use option values from other meters. Using the <a href="!meters/general-options/#MeterStyle">MeterStyle</a> option, one meter may <b>inherit</b> options from one or more "parent" sections.</p>

<h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>If an option is given on both the parent meter and the child meter, the child's setting overrides the parent's for that meter. If multiple parents are given, separated by pipes (<code>|</code>), options on later parents override those on earlier parents.</p>

<p>Inherited options are used just as if they were explicitly written in the child meter. For example, if the <a href="!variables/built-in-variables#CURRENTSECTION">#CURRENTSECTION#</a> variable is used in an inherited option, it resolves as the name of the child meter, not the parent. Similarly, if a <a href="!meters/general-options/#XY">relative position</a> is used, such as <code>X=5R</code>, the meter immediately previous to the child meter is used, not the parent's.</p>

<p>The only options that cannot be inherited are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><a href="!meters/general-options/#Meter">Meter</a>. The meter type must be explicitly set in order to identify a section as a meter.</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="!meters/general-options/#MeterStyle">MeterStyle</a> itself. This means that MeterStyles cannot be inherited through more than one generation. In other words, meters cannot have "grandparents."</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="StyleSections">MeterStyle Sections</h2>

<p>Meters may inherit options from sections that are not meters. A skin section of any name<sup>1</sup> that does not have the <code>Meter</code> or <code>Measure</code> option is treated as a MeterStyle. A MeterStyle section is completely ignored by Rainmeter unless it is referenced in the <code>MeterStyle</code> option of a meter. Options that are not valid for the child meter are also simply ignored, which means that the parent and child can be different types.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. Aside from [Rainmeter] and [Variables], which are <a href="!skins/#Format">reserved for special purposes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

``` ini
[MyFirstParent]
Meter=String
Text=I'm a parent!
X=10
FontColor=255,0,0
FontFace=Segoe UI
FontSize=15
AntiAlias=1
StringStyle=Bold

[MySecondParent]
StringStyle=Italic
FontColor=0,255,0

[MyChild]
Meter=String
MeterStyle=MyFirstParentMeter | MySecondParentMeter
FontColor=0,0,255
```

<p><em>MyChild</em> inherits all options from the <em>MyFirstParent</em> meter and the <em>MySecondParent</em> MeterStyle. This means it is displayed with all of the same font, color, size and other options given for those sections. The second parent's <code>StringStyle</code> option overrides the first parent's, which means the child meter displays italic text. Likewise, the child meter's <code>FontColor</code> option overrides both parents', so the text displays with a color of <code>0,0,255</code> (blue).</p>
