<p><a href="!meters/">Meters</a> can use option values from other meters. Using the <a href="!meters/general-options/#MeterStyle">MeterStyle</a> option, one meter may <b>inherit</b> options from one or more "parent" sections.</p>

<p>The goal is to help reduce the amount of code needed to define meter options that may be used on multiple meters. Define options once, then use them on many meters with a <code>MeterStyle</code> option.</p>

<p><code>MeterStyle</code> can be used with any type of meter.</p>

<h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>If an option is given on both the parent meter and the child meter, the child's setting overrides the parent's for that meter. If multiple parents are given, separated by pipes (<code>|</code>), options on later parents override those on earlier parents.</p>

<p>Inherited options are used just as if they were explicitly written in the child meter. For example, if the <a href="!variables/built-in-variables/#CURRENTSECTION">#CURRENTSECTION#</a> variable is used in an inherited option, it resolves as the name of the child meter, not the parent. Similarly, if a <a href="!meters/general-options/#XY">relative position</a> is used, such as <code>X=5R</code>, the meter immediately previous to the child meter is used, not the parent's.</p>

<p>The only options that cannot be inherited are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><a href="!meters/general-options/#Meter">Meter</a>. The meter type must be explicitly set in order to identify a section as a meter.</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="!meters/general-options/#MeterStyle">MeterStyle</a> itself. This means that MeterStyles cannot be inherited through more than one generation. In other words, meters cannot have "grandparents."</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="StyleSections">MeterStyle Sections</h2>

<p>Meters may inherit options from sections that are not meters. A skin section of any name<sup>1</sup> that does not have the <code>Meter</code> or <code>Measure</code> option is treated as a MeterStyle. A MeterStyle section is completely ignored by Rainmeter unless it is referenced in the <code>MeterStyle</code> option of a meter. Options that are not valid for the child meter are also simply ignored, which means that the parent and child can be different types.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. Aside from [Rainmeter] and [Variables], which are <a href="!skins/#Format">reserved for special purposes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

``` ini
[MyFirstParent]
Meter=String
Text=This is a parent!
X=10
FontColor=255,0,0
FontFace=Segoe UI
FontSize=15
SolidColor=47,47,47,190
Padding=5,2,5,5
AntiAlias=1
StringStyle=Bold

[MySecondParent]
StringStyle=Italic
FontColor=0,255,0

[MyChild]
Meter=String
MeterStyle=MyFirstParent | MySecondParent
X=0R
FontColor=62,189,255
Text=This is a child!
```

<p><em>MyChild</em> inherits all options from the <em>MyFirstParent</em> meter and the <em>MySecondParent</em> MeterStyle. This means it is displayed with all of the same font, color, size and other options given for those sections. The second parent's <code>StringStyle</code> option overrides the first parent's, which means the child meter displays italic text. Likewise, the child meter's <code>FontColor</code> option overrides both parents', so the text displays with a color of <code>62,189,255</code>.</p>
