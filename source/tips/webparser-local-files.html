<p>WebParser is commonly used for parsing a web site and retrieving information, such as weather information or an RSS feed or GMail messages. It can also be used to parse local text files on your computer. Just use the "file://" url construct instead of "https://"</p>

``` ini
[MeasureText]
Measure=WebParser
Url=file://C:\Users\YourName\Documents\TextFile.txt
RegExp="(?siU)Stuff to search for(.*)End of Search"
```

<p>WebParser will return the results of the Regular Expression search in StringIndex numbers as usual, which can be used in further measures or meters.</p>
